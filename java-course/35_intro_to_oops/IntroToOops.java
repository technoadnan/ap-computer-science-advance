      // Class :
      // A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
      // Classes do not consume any space in the memory.
      // Objects inherit methods and variables from the class.
      // It is a logical component.


      // Objects :
      // An object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template (info) is defined.
      // Every object has some address, and it occupies some space in the memory.
      // It is a physical entity.
